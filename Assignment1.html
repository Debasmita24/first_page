             Cities in the World</h1>
        <p1>
            The world is home to some 4,416 cities - from the crumbling grandeur of Rome
             to the bristling, ultra-modern towers of Shanghai. It includes tiny Adamstown,
              a microscopic settlement in the Pitcairn Islands with a population of only 48;
               it includes Venice, a floating city laced by idyllic canals and breathtaking 
              palazzos. And like the people who inhabit them, each has its own distinctive 
             personality, allure, photo-worthy moments, and reasons to pay them a visit. 
            Here, in our humble opinion, are the world’s most beautiful cities.

                While Rome may get the credit for being Italy's most historic city, 
               Florence holds the flame for sheer, unadulterated Italian beauty. 
               A walk down any cobblestone street will reveal astonishing piazzas
                and cathedrals—and the skyline dominating the cathedral of Santa Maria
                del Fiore is a cannot-miss. The museums and galleries 
                packed to the rafters with some of the world’s most exquisite, and 
                enduring, art; not least Michelangelo’s iconic David, poised beneath
                 a specially designed portal to the heavens themselves.</p2>

               Before there was St. Petersburg—Russia’s own “Paris of the East”—there
                was an area of uninhabited swampland. From these humble foundations,
                 Peter the Great, tsar until 1728, raised a Russian city to rival the
                  Baroque and Renaissance fortresses of Europe’s West, drawing heavily
                   on the regality of Paris. It is remarkable for its many discreet 
                   islands, for the pulsing artery of Nevsky Prospekt, and for the gilded,
                    imperial towers of the Hermitage.</p2>

                While Rome may get the credit for being Italy's most historic city, 
                For those who live in London and New York, it is easy to become accustomed
                 to the idea of a ‘city’ as a place of sprawling development, where nature
                  can seem very far away. Cape Town tells a different story: shadowed by the 
                  magnificent beauty of Table Mountain and its penguin-thronged beaches, 
                  the great outdoors are a vital part of daily life in this buzzing, energetic 
                  city. From the green lungs of the Kirstenbosch botanical gardens to the electrifying
                   nightlife along the V&A Waterfront, Cape Town is one of the most dramatic and
                    exciting urban locations in the world. And in 2014, it was tapped as a World Design Capital.</p2>

                    A trip to India wouldn’t be complete without experiencing the grandeur of Old City,
                     a near cinematic journey through the colors of the vast City Palace complex, the pink-hued
                      Palace of Winds, and the gigantically geometric sculptural instruments of Jantar Mantar.
                       These were built by King Sawai Jai Singh II in 1734, and today are listed as a UNESCO
                        World Heritage Site. Alongside the city’s rich and deep history, you should also stop
                         by the Jewelry District, including its stunning Gem Palace </p2>

                        A sense of the past permeates this legendary Japanese metropolis. One of the most well-preserved 
                        ancient cities in the country, a trip to Kyoto will introduce you to hundreds of years of Japanese 
                        history and landscape. From the natural splendor of its Arashiyama District (through which the 
                        tranquil Honzu River flows), thick with cherry blossom in March and April, to the 1,000 red torii
                         gates of the recognizable Fushimi Inari Shrine, the beauty in Kyoto is mesmerizing. Travelers will
                          undoubtedly find serenity and beauty at the tiered, red castle of Nijo and the city’s artfully sculpted 
                          dry landscape gardens, or karesansui. </p2>

                            Queenstown, nestled along the tranquil shores of Lake Wakatipu, is known as the adventure
                             sports capital of the world—as all true adrenaline junkies know. Surrounded by the breathtakingly 
                             dramatic landscapes of New Zealand’s South Island, the city, itself a buzzing hub for wine,
                              food and entertainment, is often described as one of the friendliest and most welcoming cities 
                              in the world. Fringed by its own Lake District and The Remarkables (a range of striking adjacent mountains),
                               this may be the most spectacularly located city in the world.</p2>

                                A city framed by fjords, Bergen has, drawn crowds in recent years from Oslo (Norway’s eclectic capital) 
                                and beyond. The primary factor for this tourism influx is its astonishing beauty—surrounded 
                                by the Seven Mountains and in close proximity to some of the country’s most dramatic coastal
                                 landscapes. The funicular to the peak of Mount Fløyen will afford the ultimate opportunity 
                                 to soak in this truly picturesque city. What’s more, its low-rise urban plan, greenery, and 
                                 copper-domed churches are a boon for those who fancy themselves a calmer urban retreat. And do

                                    Singapore is a big city. It is also an exceptionally modern city. But its size and its 
                                    modernity has not seen it sacrifice beauty to development. Unlike so many other mega 
                                    cities, Singapore has found innovative ways to reject the wholesale creation of emptily 
                                    banal non-places. Instead, it retains a huge sense of personality, character, and a strong
                                     appreciation for the natural world. From the world’s first safari park for nocturnal animals 
                                     to Jewel Changi (perhaps the most beautiful airport in the world), Singapore is a city where 
                                     the natural and the modern have found a curious way of getting along together. And it really

                                          encounters with the works of Rembrandt and Vermeer. A city made famous (and powerful) 
                                          by European trade during its 17th century Golden Age, Amsterdam is a true treasure box of 
                                          gilded canal-side buildings, ornamental facades, and beautifully detailed churches. Its exquisite
                                           canal houses and hotels also offer much to those who have a taste for more modern design.</p2>

                                            Much is spoken about Barcelona and Madrid (and with good reason), but when it comes to 
                                            glamorous urban beauty, Seville holds the crown. Historically, its message has been: Keep
                                             the flame of tradition alive. But traditions can become stultifying. In recent years, 
                                             however, this placid city has found a way to pair its jumbled, spire-thick skyline and
                                              darling courtyards with modern twists on the classics. Elegant, grand hotels—those of the 
                                              gilded golden age—and moody tabernas hold sway alongside chic cocktail bars and modern music 
                                              venues. Sun-soaked, small, and steeped in atmosphere, Seville’s Gothic and Renaissance charm 
                                              has made it one of Spain’s hottest new urban destinations.</p2>
